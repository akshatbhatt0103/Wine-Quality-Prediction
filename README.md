# Wine-Quality-Prediction

### Introduction:
To predict the quality of wine using the wine dataset we will make a machine learning model to make the prediction. I will be using advanced machine learning algorithms to make the prediction model. The main objective of this model is to accurately predict the wine quality by Training and Testing data from the given dataset. I will be using algorithms like- Random Forest Classifier to make the model and then analyse our prediction using different scores like: accuracy, precision etc.

### Algorithm:
The algorithm used for this model is Random Forest Classifier. Random Forest is a Flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces a great result most of the time. It is also one of the most used algorithms, because of its simplicity and diversity. It is a supervised learning algorithm and can be used for both classification as well as regression. Random forest adds additional randomness to the model, while growing the trees. Instead of searching for the most important feature while splitting a node, it searches for the best feature among a random subset of features.
